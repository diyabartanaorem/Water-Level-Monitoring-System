I declare that the thesis entitled \textbf{"SMART WATER LEVEL MONITORING SYSTEM USING MICROCONTROLLER"} submitted in partial fulfillment for the award of the degree of \textbf{Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering} is a record of original work carried out by me under the guidance of \textbf{Dr. Hanjabam Saratchandra Sharma}, and has not formed the basis for the award of any other degree or diploma in this or any other institution or university. In keeping with the typical practice in reporting scientific information, due acknowledgements have been made of whatever findings of others have been cited.
