\noindent
This project uses IoT technology to address water management challenges through real-time monitoring, automation, water conservation, remote access, and cost-efficiency. IoT sensors provide continuous updates on water levels, enabling timely responses to changes and improving management efficiency. Automatically controls pumps based on water levels, reducing manual labor, preventing errors, and saving water and electricity. Prevents overflows, minimizes wastage, and helps track water usage for better resource management, especially in drought-prone areas. Users can monitor water levels and control pumps remotely via mobile apps or online platforms, ensuring convenience and connectivity. Utilizes affordable sensors and energy-efficient components, reducing labor, water, and energy costs over the long term.
